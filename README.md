## Project definition
> ​ It is required to implement the first stages of the data processing pipeline, which will involve the
   transformation, storage, and querying of unstructured data. In this project, it will be provided with an unstructured dataset containing records collected from a microblogging service. Each record will contain a timestamp, an identifier, and a short block of text. It is going to be constructed a data processing pipeline using a MongoDB datastore, and run create and compute a set of queries.

 ## DataSet Description
 The dataset contains the following fields:
 *	id - a unique identifier of the tuple
 *	id_member - a unique identifier of the user who posted the message
 *	timestamp - a UTC timestamp of when the message was published
 *	text - the microblog message that was published
 *	geo_lat - the latitude coordinate of where the message was posted from
 *	geo_lng - the longitude coordinate of where the message was posted from

## Programming language.
Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
